# Get host ip address behind load balancer using proxy protocol.

The ProxyHeaderPackets.dpr project represents a code example for the [Get host ip address behind load balancer using proxy protocol.](https://www.clevercomponents.com/portal/kb/a84/get-host-ip-address-behind-load-balancer-using-proxy-protocol_.aspx) tutorial.   

The PROXY protocol provides a convenient way to safely transport connection information such as a client's address across multiple layers of NAT, TCP proxies or load balancers. The described code parses this information and removes the proxy header packet from the data stream. The example program utilizes the IMAP server component behind an Amazon load balancer (ELB).

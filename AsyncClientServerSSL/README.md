# Asynchronous SSL client / server

The AsyncClientServerSSL.dpr project represents a code example for the [Asynchronous SSL client / server](https://www.clevercomponents.com/portal/kb/a71/asynchronous-ssl-client-server.aspx) tutorial.   

The client connects to the server via SSL and sends/receives data. The server accepts data from the client and also allows you to send non-requested data to connected clients.

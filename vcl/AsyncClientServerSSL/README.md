# Asynchronous SSL client / server



The AsyncClientServerSSL project is a sample implementation for the [Asynchronous SSL client / server](https://www.clevercomponents.com/portal/kb/a71/asynchronous-ssl-client-server.aspx) tutorial.



The client connects to the server over SSL, then sends and receives data.



The server accepts data from the client and can also push data to connected clients without a prior client request.

# VK Authorization, getting the OAUTH code in Delphi App using TWebBrowser

The VKontakteOAuth project represents a code example for the [VK Authorization, getting the OAUTH code in Delphi App using TWebBrowser](https://www.clevercomponents.com/portal/kb/a111/vk-authorization-getting-the-oauth-code-in-delphi-app-using-twebbrowser.aspx) tutorial.   

This tutorial demonstrates how to authorize at VK.com social Network and get access to the user's photo gallery.   

## ⚠️ Important Note

**This tutorial code is outdated** and demonstrates the legacy VK OAuth implementation. Modern VK authentication uses **VK ID** - the new unified authentication system from VK.

For production applications, please refer to the official [VK ID OAuth documentation](https://id.vk.com/about/business/go/docs/ru/vkid/latest/oauth-vk) which provides up-to-date endpoints, security practices, and implementation guidelines.

# FTP Directory Tree Viewer

Windows VCL application that visually displays the complete directory structure of an FTP server using Clever Internet Suite.

The FtpDirTree project is a code example for the [Get the complete FTP directory tree](https://www.clevercomponents.com/portal/kb/a72/get-the-complete-ftp-directory-tree_.aspx) tutorial.   


## Overview

This application connects to an FTP server and recursively scans its directory tree, displaying the structure in a text format with visual indentation. The tool uses tab characters to represent directory levels, creating a clear hierarchical view of the server's contents.
